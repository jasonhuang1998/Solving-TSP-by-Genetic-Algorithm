## Introduction
* The code for Artificial Intelligence cources at NCUE.
* Use Genetic Algorithm to implement Travelling salesman problem(TSP).
* Two ways of mating and mutation  are designed.

## Input File
* Integer 'n' at the first row means that there are n nodes 
* The second row to the n+1 th row is a n*n matrix
* The elements in the matrix mean the distance between a node to another, and must be positive integer or 0(means that there are no edge between those nodes).
* A connection from a node to itself is not permitted(all diagonal element are 0).
* All elements in the matrix are seperated by space.
